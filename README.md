# Nex Lang

Nex Lang is a toy programming language, written in C++, that was created as a side project (hobby).

Features:
- Variables
- Exit statements
- Mathematical operations
- Comments
- Arrays
- Set statements
- Go statements
- Reassignment
- Ifz (If zero) statements
- El (Else) statements
- Input
- Output

Starting out:
- [Build the project and learn how to compile code](INFO.md)
- [Work through the documentation](docs/DOCS.pdf)

Todo:
- [ ] Fix Nex emitting a lot of repeating assembly instructions.
- [ ] Improve Input/Output.
- [ ] Wrap repeated functionality in functions.
- [ ] Reimplement the way control flow is implemented in generated assembly.
- [ ] Better error messages.

These improvements will be a part of my next compiler instead of being added to this project.
