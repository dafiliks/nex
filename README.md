# Nex Lang

Nex Lang is a toy programming language, written in C++, that was created as a side project (hobby).

Features:
- Variables
- Exit statements
- Mathematical operations
- Comments
- Arrays
- Set statements
- Go statements
- Reassignment
- Ifz (If zero) statements
- El (Else) statements
- Input
- Output

Starting out:
- [Build the project and learn how to compile code](INFO.md)
- [Work through the documentation](docs/DOCS.pdf)

Todo:
- Currently, Nex Lang emits a lot of repeating assembly instructions
- Control flow in assembly could be implemented in an "easier to read" style
- Compiler needs better error messages - preferably with line numbers
- Adding to the first point, assembly needs to get optimized more

These improvements will probably be a part of my next compiler instead of being added to this project.
